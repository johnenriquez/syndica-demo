Syndica is a large network of business professionals that works together with startups to help them succeed. Founders submit their startup onto the Syndica platform, and our members try to provide help and support in any way possible (e.g. new ideas, feedback, customer acquisition, solve business problems, etc.). Syndica is a free service; all members are MBAs or MBA Alumni from the UCLA Anderson School of Management.
