      <h2 class="h4 mt-5 mb-2 text-primary">THE SYNDICA PLATFORM</h2>

      <p>
        <b class="text-primary">Syndica Connects Companies and MBAs</b><br />
        Syndica is a communications platform that enables the connection between Companies and MBAs.  Companies and MBAs are hereinafter referred to as “Users.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="text-primary">Syndica Only Provides a Venue</b><br />
        Syndica is a platform for enabling connections between Users to collaborate on business challenges and business development.  However, Syndica is not responsible for the performance of Users, nor does it have control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of the communications between Users.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b class="text-primary">User Vetting</b><br />
        Users are approved on the Syndica platform through valid email addresses (e.g. company emails, or business school emails for MBAs); however, Users are not subject to extensive background checks before their use of the platform. Syndica cannot confirm with absolute certainty that each User is who they claim to be and therefore, Syndica cannot and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of identity or any information provided through the Syndica platform.
      </p>
      <p>When interacting with other Users, you should exercise caution and common sense to protect your personal safety and property, just as you would when interacting with other persons whom you don’t know.</p>
