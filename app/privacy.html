      <p>We recognize that your privacy is very important and take it seriously.</p>
      <p>Our Syndica Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use, disclosure, and sharing of your information when you use Syndica and the Syndica platform (collectively “Syndica”).

      <p>The Syndica platform has two main categories of users:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Companies, such as startups or mid-size businesses (“Company” or “Companies”)</li>
        <li>Individuals, such as MBAs or other professionals (“Individual User” or “Individual Users”)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We will make distinctions between the two user categories in this Privacy Policy as necessary.</p>
